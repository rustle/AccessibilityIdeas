##Accessibility Geometry

This project demonstrates a few ideas for how UIAccessibility could make containers and elements more useful and require less subclassing.

* Support for adding accessibilityElements that aren't views directly to views without subclassing
* A prebuilt container UIAccessibilityElement subclass
* Support for explicit ordering of accessibilityElements within their container without subclassing
* Support for a frame property on elements that is relative to it's container
